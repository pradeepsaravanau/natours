//So again many packages on npm that we use for Express development actually depend on thisenvironment variable.And so when our project is ready and we are gonna deploy it,we then should change the node env and variable to production.And we will do that of course once we deploy the project by the end of the course.So we set node env and X as environment variables,but we can do a lot more.

//And that's because we usually use environment variables like configuration settings for our applications.So whenever our app needs some configuration for stuff that might change based on the environment that the app is running in, we use environment variables.For example we might use different databases for developmentand for testing until we could define one variable for each and then activate the right database according to the environment.Also we could set sensitive data like passwords and user name using environment variables.

//central place for all unhandled errors
process.on('unhandledRejection', err => {
  console.log(err.name, err.message);

  console.log(`unhandledRejection ! ðŸ’¥ shutting down`);
  //1 for uncaught exception  , 0 for success
  //to close the server we store the app.listen in the variable
  server.close(() => {
    process.exit(1);
  });
